      <p>
        You gotta learn to listen, listen to learn<br />
        You gotta learn to listen, before you get burned<br />
        Learn to listen, listen to learn<br />
        You gotta learn to listen, before you get burned<br /><br />

        You gotta have fun, not a fix in the arm<br />
        You gotta stay out of deep water<br />
        Happiness is something you've gotta earn<br />
        You gotta fight to make (your love into returns)<br /><br />

        Learn to listen, listen to learn<br />
        You gotta learn to listen, before you get burned<br /><br />

        You got (the rights) and there's always a temptation<br />
        This one more screwed up the nation<br />
        Gotta have a plan, gotta learn to listen<br />
        Gotta take a stab, you have my blessing, alright<br /><br />

        You gotta take the cotton out of your ears<br />
        You gotta start hanging on to all your (affairs)<br />
        I've lived your life for so many years<br />
        All I got was self-pity and tears<br /><br />

        Learn to listen, listen to learn<br />
        You gotta learn to listen, before you get burned<br /><br />
