        <pre>
        You gotta learn to listen, listen to learn
        You gotta learn to listen, before you get burned
        Learn to listen, listen to learn
        You gotta learn to listen, before you get burned

        You gotta have fun, not a fix in the arm
        You gotta stay out of deep water
        Happiness is something you've gotta earn
        You gotta fight to make (your love into returns)

        Learn to listen, listen to learn
        You gotta learn to listen, before you get burned

        You got (the rights) and there's always a temptation
        This one more screwed up the nation<
        Gotta have a plan, gotta learn to listen
        Gotta take a stab, you have my blessing, alright

        You gotta take the cotton out of your ears
        You gotta start hanging on to all your (affairs)
        Ive lived your life for so many years
        All I got was self-pity and tears

        Learn to listen, listen to learn
        You gotta learn to listen, before you get burned
